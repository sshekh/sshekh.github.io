   <LI><b> <FONT COLOR="red"> ** </FONT> Exploring a Binary Heap </b> <P></P>
Consider a binary heap containing <i>n </i>numbers 
(the root stores the greatest number). You are given a 
positive integer <i> k < n </i> and a number <i> x </i>. You have to 
determine whether the <i>k</i>th largest element of the heap is greater than 
<i>x</i> or not. Your algorithm must take <i>O(k)</i> time. You may use
<i>O(k) </i> extra storage.

  <LI><b><FONT COLOR="red"> * </FONT> Merging two search trees</b> <P></P>
You are given two height balanced binary 
search trees <i> T </i> and <i>T'</i>, storing <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> elements 
respectively. Every element of tree <i>T </i> is smaller than every element of 
tree <i>T'</i>. Every node <i>u</i> also stores height of the subtree rooted 
at it. Using this extra information how can you merge the two trees
in time <i> O(</i>log <i> m </i> +  log <i> n)</i>  
(preserving both the height balance and the order)?    <P></P>

  <LI><b><FONT COLOR="red"> ** </FONT> Complete binary tree as an efficient 
data-structure </b><P> </P>
  You are given an array of size <i>n</i>(<i>n</i> being a power of two).
All the entries of the array are initialized to zero.
You have to perform a sequence of the following online operations :
<UL>
<LI><b> (i) </b> <i>Add(i,x)</i> which adds <i>x</i> to the entry 
A[<i>i</i>].
<LI><b>(ii) </b> Report <i>sum(i,j) </i> = sum of the entries in the
array from indices <i>i </i> to <i> j </i>for any <i> 0 < i < j <= n</i>.
</UL>
It can be seen easily that we can perform the first operation in <i> 
O(</i>1<i>)</i> time whereas the second operation may cost <i>O(n)</i> in 
worst case.
Your objective is to perform these operations efficiently. 
Give a data-structure which will guarantee <i>O(log n) </i>
time per operation. (The title of the problem is a hint).

<FONT COLOR="Red"> Hint : </FONT>

I think you are trying to find the <i>k</i>th largest element in the heap in
<i>O(k)</i> time in order to solve this problem. But actually, you 
<b>need not </b> find the <i>k</i>th 
largest element in the heap to solve this problem. You will be able to
solve the problem if you are able to find whether the number of elements in 
the heap which are greater than <i>x</i> are more/less/equal to <i>k </i>. 
Now exploit the definition of the heap, to do this task in <i>O(k)</i> time.
Note that you have extra <i> O(k) </i> storage space to use.

<FONT COLOR="Red"> Hint : </FONT>
This is a very nice exercise to understand the technique of Amortized Analysis.
You know that actual cost of <b>Delete-min</b> is <i>O(log n)</i>. So you have
to choose a potential function such that during the <b>Delete-min</b> 
operation, change in the potential function is <i> - O(log n) </i>(to balance 
the actual cost).
<BR>
Now concentrate on the tree structure of the binary heap to realize what 
happens when the minimum element is deleted. Look on the following diagram
to see what is happening during <b>Delete-min</b> :

Compare the two tree structures above. What is missing in the tree after

<FONT COLOR="Red"> Hint : </FONT>

Some simple observations from the definition of scorpion graph are :
<OL>
<LI> The only vertex of degree <i>n-2</i> is <i>body</i>.
<LI> There is no edge between any foot and the sting.
<LI> There is no edge between any foot and the tail.
</OL>
We shall use above observations to give the <i>O(n)</i> time algorithm
for verifying whether given graph is a scorpion graph or not.
<BR>
Let <i>M</i> be the adjacency matrix of the graph. 
<BR>
Pick a vertex <i>v</i> arbitrarily. Let <i>d</i> be the degree of <i>v</i>(can
be found out from the adjacency matrix in time <i>O(n)</i>). 
From the definition of scorpion it is clear that if <i>d </i> is 1,2 or n-2, 
we can easily check whether the graph is scorpion or not(convince yourself). 
Let us consider the case when $2 < d < n-2$. Clearly  <i>v</i> must be a foot.
Now Let  <i>A</i>  be the set of vertices which are adjacent to <i>v</i>,
and  <i>B</i> be the set of vertices which are not adjacent to  <i>v</i>.
<BR>
<b>Observations :</b> 
<UL>
<LI> The  <i>body</i> must belong to set  <i>A</i>.
<LI> The <i>sting</i> must belong to set  <i>B</i>. 
</UL>
Now we shall successively eliminate the verticess of set  <i>A</i> and 
<i>B</i> which are feet. Finally we shall  
be left with  <i>A</i> or  <i>B</i> containing single vertex. At this point 
you can easily verify in <i>O(n)</i> time whether the given graph is scorpion.
Now we shall describe a way to successively eliminate the vertices of set 
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> until one of them becomes a singleton set.
<BR>

<UL>
Pick two nodes <i>x,y</i> from set <i>A</i>. 
<LI>
If <i>M[x,y] =0</i>, then throw both of them away since none of them can be a 
<i>body</i>. 
<LI>else
<UL>
pick one node say <i>z</i> from <i>B</i>. 
<LI>
If <i>M[x,z] = 1</i> and <i>M[y,z]= 1</i>, throw <i>z</i> away since 
<i>z</i> can't be <i>sting</i>.
<LI>
If <i>M[x,z] = 1</i> and <i>M[y,z]= 0</i>, throw <i>y</i> away since 
<i>y</i> can not be <i>body</i>.
<LI>
If <i>M[x,z] = 0</i> and <i>M[y,z]= 1</i>, throw <i>x</i> away since 
<i>x</i> can not be <i>body</i>.
<LI>
If <i>M[x,z]=M[y,z]=0</i>, then pick one more vertex say <i>w</i> from set <i>B</i>.
Try to eleiminate <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> if possible as in case of <i>z</i>.
If we are still stuck i.e. <i>M[x,w]=M[y,w]=0</i>, then through both 
<i> x,y</i> since none of them can be a <i> body </i>.
</UL>
<u> So by a constant number of lookups of the adjacency matrix we are able to 
eliminate atleast one  foot from set <i>A</i> or <i>B</i>.</u>
</UL>
