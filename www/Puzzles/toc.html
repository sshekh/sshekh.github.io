   <LI><b>Searching the friend moving in an infinite 3-D grid</b>
First let us define a grid : Consider 3-D space. Every (<i>i,j,k</i>) where
<i>i,j,k</i> are integers, corresponds to a node. A node is adjacent to those
nodes whose two out of three co-ordinates are same as that of given node
and the third co-ordinate differs by +1 or -1. So every node is adjacent to 
exactly six nodes.
 
Your friend is standing at a node somewhere in a 3-D grid. After every second
he moves to one out of the six neighboring nodes. Your objective is to locate 
your friend. You have a control panel using which after every second you can 
chose some node in the grid and determine whether your friend is there or not.
You will get answer yes/no. Give an <b><i>effective</i></b> scheme to locate 
your friend,provided he changes his direction atmost a finite number of 
times(however large it may be).
