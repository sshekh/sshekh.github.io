"The Dictator" will give you a good time laughing for its near 90 minute run. It is funny, senseless and obscene. It will provide you with a lot of political, racist and sexist humor, certainly not for you if you get offended easily. 

Sacha Cohen plays Admiral Aladeen, the narcisst dictator of the Arabian nation Wadiya. Here he owns a huge palace, where he executes people with the flip of a finger,
plays terrorist attack games and keeps a photo wall of celebrities he has slept with. His general Tamir tries to assassinate him multiple times in greed for the throne, 
but fails. Aladeen's recent address regarding Nuclear Weapons has created a havoc in the political world and now he must give a speech in the United Nations 
regarding this. Tamir plans to assassinate him here and somehow things end up with Aladeen out into the New York downtown clad in his underpants. 

Here he meets a kind-hearted liberal girl Zoya who offers him a job at her food store. Aladeen runs into a restaurant in a "Little Wadiya" neighborhood full of people 
he had sentenced to execution. He meets his chief missile scientist, Nadal and together they hatch a plan to get to the hotel and place Aladeen where he belongs. 
The plan progresses along with the story, and so does romance as Aladeen finds himself falling for Zoya despite radical difference between their beliefs.
Meanwhile, vulgar humor continues. 

It is a good timepass, with a casually flowing story and satirical jokes. Cohen does a good job at keeping you smiling with his funny accent and fake names. Watch it 
if you have some time to kill :P.

PS : In the movie, Aladeen always wanted to bomb Israel with his Nuclear Bombs. Ironical that I watched it at a time when Israel is bombing Gaza (and vice versa).
In this troubled world, a happy moment is always appreciated.
