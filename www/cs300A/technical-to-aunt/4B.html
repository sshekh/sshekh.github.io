<h1>Favourite programming language - C++</h1> <br />
<p>
<b>To a student who has done ESC101 </b> <br /> 
You have been introduced to C programming language in the ESC101 course. C++ was developed to provide an efficiency and flexibility like C as well as higher level features for better program organisation. C++ is a superset language of C, that means essentially any C code can also run as a C++ code. Apart from that, it provides many additional features to the user like Object Oriented Programming, Template libraries, Template metaprogramming etc. <br /> <br />

Object oriented programming or OOP is a programming paradigm in which you have “Objects” that have associated data fields and procedures to act on that data fields. OOP is more close to real life in the way that it provides a more accurate description of the real world, for ex - you can have an object student that has a lot of data fields like roll no, name etc.  This feature is very useful in designing large programs and softwares. <br /><br />

Standard Library provided by C++ is much richer in terms of the functionality and much more powerful. C++ uses namespaces that help in case of grouping identifiers of a particular functionality. Namespaces are very useful if you are using different libraries for your project. Also, it provides different containers (like map, vector, set) for storing data that is to be used for different purposes. It also provides different algorithmic functions related to sorting, searching, etc like binary_search, random_shuffle, next_permutation, set_intersection, etc. <br /><br />

Template metaprogramming is a set of powerful programming techniques, which when used with care and taste can help solve quite tricky problems. It is mainly used for generic programming, like making a sorting algorithm implementation that can be used with any data type provided the type has a partial weak ordering defined. In generic programming, I can define operators (like +, -, *, /, ==, <) on user defined data types and use them like normal ones. For example, I can define a polynomial class and define the operator +, -, *, / on them. Using that I can perform arithmetic operations on them (P1 + P2 / P3 * P4) just like you do on integers in C. <br /><br />

There are many more, but I cannot list them all here, I hope you understand that C++ is definitely one of the best languages that is around. It has been one of the most popular languages for quite a long time in the programming world despite the fact that programming community evolves very rapidly. <br /><br />

<b>To an aunt who knows how to surf the internet </b> <br />
Dear aunty, you must have seen how large the internet is and the large variety of things that are present there.  Have you even wondered how these things work ? Basically everything that you use on your computer, from microsoft word to your browser is a computer program. A program is a set of very basic instructions that your computer can perform. There are different types of programs, the web pages that you see on the internet are also programs, those programs are decoded by the browser to present to you the webpage as you see it. Programs are written in a programming language, since there are different types of programs, the programming languages used to write them are also different. Hundreds of programming languages are present in the world, but only a handful of them are used widely. My favourite among them is C++. This is a very powerful programming language that can perform a wide variety of tasks. A lot of softwares in your computer are written using C++. These include your web browser (Internet Explorer, Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox), Microsoft Office and VLC media player is also written in C++. The websites you visit on the internet (like facebook, youtube, google) have a front-end and a back-end. The front end is the part which is visible to you on the browser. The back-end is the part which they use to store their data. Most of the websites have their backend written in C++. This is because C++ is very efficient and flexible. It also provides very high level general features that are useful in writing large softwares. These features make C++ one of the most popular programming languages worldwide for a very long time.
