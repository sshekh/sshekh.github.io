### [](#header-3)Training Recurrent Neural Nets with Backpropation through time.

For understanding backprop in matrix notation, look at [this excellent post](http://simonpf.github.io/gsoc/posts/2016-06-06-neural-networks-and-backpropagation.html)
By Simon. I will try to explain how we can extend it to Recurrent Networks and its implementation in `TMVA::DNN`.
